## The Simurgh Symbol

**Simurgh** = **Si Murgh** (Persian: thirty birds)

The 30 birds seek the Simurgh across seven valleys.
Final revelation: *they themselves are the Simurgh*.

This is Wahdat al-Wujud (Unity of Being):
- Seeker = Sought
- Creation = Divine manifestation (tajalli)
- Human essence = Divine essence veiled
